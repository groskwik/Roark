# Roark for HP-71B Calculator
Roarks's Formula for Stress and Strain
http://materiales.azc.uam.mx/gjl/Clases/MA10_I/Roark%27s%20formulas%20for%20stress%20and%20strain.pdf

## Shear, moment, slope, and deflection formulas for elastic straight beams (Table 8.1)

### Concentrated intermediate load
Case 1a to 1f are implemented

### Partial distributed load
Case 2a to 2f are implemented

## Usage
The program asks for the inputs. The variable names are the same as defined in the Roark's.

## Outputs
The program computes:
- The reaction forces at beam supports
- The bending moment at beam supports
- The maximum bending moment
- The maximum deflection
- The deflection along the beam for a given range
